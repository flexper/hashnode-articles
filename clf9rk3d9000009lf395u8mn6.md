When building an application that needs to support multiple languages and locales, it is important to have a good internationalization (I18n) solution. This is where Rosetty comes in. Rosetty is a complete Intl/I18n solution for both browser and node environments. It provides a powerful set of tools that make it easy to build applications that can be easily localized for any language or locale.

## Features

Some of the features of Rosetty include:

* Simple API for translating text into any language
    
* Support for React via [Rosetty React](https://github.com/flexper/rosetty-react)
    
* Consistent translation of language, region, and script display names via `displayNames` API
    
* Language-sensitive list formatting via `listFormat` API
    
* Language-sensitive number formatting via `numberFormat` API
    
* Plural-sensitive formatting and plural-related language rules via `pluralRules` API
    
* Powerful date and time formatting via the `format`, `formatRelative`, `formatDistance`, `formatDistanceToNow`, and `formatDuration` APIs
    

## Usage

To get started with Rosetty, simply install it via npm:

```bash
npm install rosetty
```

Once you have installed Rosetty, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
const { rosetty, locales } = require('rosetty');

const { enGB: enLocale } = locales;

const r = rosetty(
  {
    en: {
      dict: {
        test: 'This is a test',
      },
      locale: enLocale,
    },
  },
  'en'
);

console.log(r.t('test')); // This is a test
```

## API

### rosetty(config, defaultLang?, fallback?)

`rosetty` is the main API of Rosetty. It takes in a configuration object, an optional default language, and an optional fallback value, and returns a set of functions that can be used for internationalization.

**Options**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| config | Record&lt;string, Language&gt; | Specify dictionary and locale to use for each language |
| defaultLang | string? | Specify the default language to use (should be the same as config) |
| fallback | boolean? | Return the fallback value if the translation is not defined |

**Return**

1. `changeLang`: A function that takes a string argument and changes the current language being used by the library to the language specified in the argument.
    
2. `languages`: An array of strings containing all the languages available for translation.
    
3. `getCurrentLang`: A function that returns the current language being used by the library.
    
4. `t`: A function that takes a string key and an optional object of parameters, and returns the corresponding translation for the current language.
    
5. `displayNames`: A class that provides consistent translation of language, region, and script display names.
    
6. `listFormat`: A class that provides language-sensitive list formatting.
    
7. `numberFormat`: A class that provides language-sensitive number formatting.
    
8. `pluralRules`: A class that provides plural-sensitive formatting and plural-related language rules.
    
9. `format`: A function that takes a date and a string format and returns the formatted date string in the given format.
    
10. `formatRelative`: A function that takes a date and a base date, and returns the representation of the date in words relative to the base date.
    
11. `formatDistance`: A function that takes two dates and returns the distance between them in words.
    
12. `formatDistanceToNow`: A function that takes a date and returns the distance between the date and the current time in words.
    
13. `formatDuration`: A function that takes a duration and returns a human-readable duration string, such as "9 months 2 days".
    
14. `locales`: An object containing locale files from the `date-fns` library.
